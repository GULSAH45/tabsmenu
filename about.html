          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <div class="story-text">
            <p>
              In 2018, what started as a semester abroad in Lima, Peru,
              transformed into an unexpected culinary adventure that would shape
              my future. As a Japanese culinary student with a passion for
              traditional cooking, I found myself captivated by Peru's vibrant
              food scene and its unique connection to Japanese cuisine through
              the Nikkei community.
            </p>

            <p>
              Living on a tight student budget, I spent my weekends exploring
              local markets and small family-owned restaurants. It was in these
              humble settings that I discovered the magic of Peruvian-Japanese
              fusion. The way local chefs combined fresh Peruvian ingredients
              with Japanese techniques fascinated me. I was particularly struck
              by how they transformed traditional sushi rolls using local ají
              peppers and tropical fruits, creating something entirely new yet
              familiar.
            </p>

            <p>
              My breakthrough moment came during a university cooking
              competition where I presented a fusion dish: "Anticucho-style
              Yakitori" - Japanese chicken skewers marinated in a
              Peruvian-inspired sauce made with ají panca and soy sauce. The
              judges were impressed by this unexpected combination, and their
              enthusiasm sparked an idea. With encouragement from my professors
              and support from a small group of fellow students, I started
              hosting weekly pop-up dinners in my apartment.
            </p>

            <p>
              Word spread quickly through the university community, and soon my
              tiny apartment kitchen could barely keep up with the demand. Local
              food bloggers discovered our hidden gem, and their reviews caught
              the attention of a small business incubator. They offered me a
              chance to turn my pop-up into a proper restaurant, providing both
              guidance and initial funding.
            </p>

            <p>
              Today, Inari Takashi stands as a testament to that journey of
              discovery. Our menu features dishes that tell the story of two
              rich culinary traditions meeting in unexpected ways. From our
              signature Ceviche Ramen, which combines the citrusy freshness of
              Peruvian ceviche with the comfort of Japanese ramen, to our
              Miso-Rocoto glazed Black Cod, each dish represents a careful
              balance of flavors and techniques from both cultures.
            </p>

            <p>
              What began as a student's culinary experiment has evolved into a
              celebration of cultural fusion. We continue to innovate while
              respecting the traditions that inspired us, creating dishes that
              surprise and delight our guests. At Inari Takashi, every meal is
              an invitation to join us on this exciting journey of flavor
              discovery.
